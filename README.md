## Roadmap

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involved cleaning and preprocessing the movie dataset to make it suitable for the recommendation system.

2. **Web Scraping**: This involved writing scripts to automatically extract movie details and user ratings from various online sources, providing a rich and diverse dataset for our recommendation system.

3. **Recommendation System**: I built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, a popular method for building recommendation systems.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated using metrics such as r2_score, accuracy_score, etc.

5. **Deployment with Heroku**: The final step was deploying the recommendation system on Heroku. This allowed the model to be accessed via a simple web interface, enabling real-time recommendations.
## Lessons Learned

This project was a fascinating exploration of recommendation systems and cloud deployment. It was particularly interesting to see how these techniques can be applied to provide personalized movie recommendations.
