## Roadmap

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involved cleaning and preprocessing the movie dataset to make it suitable for the recommendation system. This included handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Web Scraping**: The data used in this project was obtained through web scraping. This involved writing scripts to automatically extract movie details and user ratings from various online sources, providing a rich and diverse dataset for our recommendation system.

3. **Recommendation System**: I built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, a popular method for building recommendation systems. This method makes automatic predictions about a user’s interests by collecting preferences from many users.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the recommendation system was evaluated using metrics such as r2_score, accuracy_score, etc. This helped in identifying the effectiveness of the recommendation system.


## Lessons Learned

This project was a fascinating exploration of recommendation systems. It was particularly interesting to see how these techniques can be applied to provide personalized movie recommendations.
